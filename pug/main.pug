Say you go paddleboarding for the first time. You’ve never done anything like it, but you suddenly have a distinct memory of making the same arm motions, under the same blue sky, with the same waves lapping at your feet.","img":"./assets/img1.jpg"}

What’s more, déjà vu experiences tend to end as quickly as they begin. The sensation may be so fleeting that if you don’t know much about déjà vu, you may not even realize what just happened.","img":"./assets/img2.jpg"}
